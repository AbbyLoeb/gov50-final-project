## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the adoption of pro-LGBT laws, such as anti-discrimination laws and marriage-equality laws, and public acceptance/support of LGBT people in the US. How long does it take pro-LGBT opinions to reflect in legislation? How do laws not enacted by popular support change support of LGBT measures, such as impact of the Obergefell decision in states that hadn't enacted marraige equality beforehand? I think this would be interesting to explore, especially in considering whether state or federal laws or more effective in creating pro-LGBT sentiment and better direct lobbying/activist activity.
